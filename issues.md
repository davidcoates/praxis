Keep prefix negation but change operator sections?
(_ - 2) for operator seciton, (-2) for negate 2 ?

Subexpression with type parameters that don't appear in superexpression
e.g., length [undefined] :: Int
[undefined] :: a

Type defaulting is bad. In haskell it is mostly done for Num.
How to avoid but still have nice numeric literals?
Int vs Integer for literals , right now it isn't consistent.


To avoid linear functions, functions shouldn't capture linear types.
So we can share and drop functions.
